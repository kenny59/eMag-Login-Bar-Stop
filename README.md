# eMag Login Bar Stop

Remove annoying login bar on bottom of screen when browsing on emag.hu/bg/ro

Usage:

- Download ZIP file
- Add it to Chrome ([link](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-install-a-chrome-extension-from-github/))
- Enjoy:)



What it does:

- It overrides a CSS property to disable the popup. "source" above



Reason it is not on Chrome Web Store:

- I didn't want to pay 5$ to put it up. Not much of an extension dev.
